#Wireframe Ripple Simulation

Contributers&ensp;Â·&ensp;[Hunter Larco](http://larcolabs.com)

> This is the first HTML5 program I wrote. Written during my sophomore year in highschool I came up derived the 3D rotation algorithm found in the Initial Commit and designed this 3D simulation to demonstrate it. As my first project of its kind there is no GPU integration and true to my roots I haven't changed that so it may render slowly.
