#Wireframe Ripple Simulation

Contributers&ensp;Â·&ensp;[Hunter Larco](http://larcolabs.com)

> This is the first HTML5 program I wrote. Written during my sophomore year in highschool I came up derived the 3D rotation algorithm found in the Initial Commit and designed this 3D simulation to demonstrate it. As my first project of its kind there is no GPU integration and true to my roots I haven't changed that so it may render slowly.

## Notable Mentions

Chrome Experiments accepted the [original version](https://www.chromeexperiments.com/experiment/wireframe-ripple-simulation) on Sept. 13, 2012.

## TODO

* The 2015 reboot is terribly inefficient but much cleaner code. The lack of objects in the original version sped it up. Try to find a happy compromise.
